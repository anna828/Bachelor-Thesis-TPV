Bachelor Thesis - The Powerspectrum of a gravito-turbulent accretion disk.

This git-repository should provide addtional material for the bachelor thesis. 
It is mainly used to provide videos showing the simulated surface densities of an accretion disk. This is because it is not possible to display all surface plots in the work.
The University of Bayreuth, Theoretical Physics V provided the simulation code and the server to run it on.
