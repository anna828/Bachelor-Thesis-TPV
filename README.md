Bachelor Thesis - The power spectrum of a gravito-turbulent accretion disk.

This git-repository should provide addtional material for the bachelor thesis written by Anna-Maria Pleyer. 
It is mainly used to provide videos showing the simulated surface densities of an gravito-turbulent accretion disk. 
It is not possible to display all surface plots in the bachelor thesis, so this github repository was made.
The University of Bayreuth, Theoretical Physics V provided the simulation code and the servers to simulate the data on which the images and videos are made of.
